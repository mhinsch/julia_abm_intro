# A short introduction to Julia and Agent-Based Modelling (ABM)

This is a very short introduction originally created for a stats course at Southampton University. Klicking on the link at the bottom will start the notebook interface on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/). From there you can then open the individual notebooks (*.ipynb): 
* `intro_jupyter_julia` gives a very quick introduction to Jupyter and Julia
* `intro_abm_jl_1` introduce a simple agent-based [SIR model](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SIRModel.html)
* `intro_abm_jl_2` adds a view things to the model to make it more interesting
* `intro_abm_jl_3` shows how to generate data and display the results
 
If you just want a preview without running the notebooks you can have a look at the corresponding .md files.

To run the notebooks press here (might take a while):
