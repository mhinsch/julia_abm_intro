    "Statically typed languages such as C or C++ assign a fixed type to every variable that can't be changed. This holds for function parameters as well. Therefore calling a function that expects an `int` using a variable that is of type `vector` will produce an error at compile time. This can make it a lot easier to find or avoid mistakes and - as a bonus - makes it easier for the compiler to produce optimized code. On the flip side it can be cumbersome to have to decide ahead of time and declare the type of each and every variable and function parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to that Python and R sit on the dynamic end of the range. Variables don't have a fixed type and can change it during their lifetime by assigning different things to them.

    "\n",
    "Julia combines both approaches in a pretty clever way. In principle, everything in Julia has a well-defined type. However, in contrast to C/C++ the type is not attached to *expressions at compile-time* but instead to *objects at run-time*. But, similar to C/C++ and other than e.g. Python, Julia *does* use type information to select which function to call in a given situation and to optimize code. It does that by inferring the type of function parameters and re-compiling (if necessary) the function *with these types*."
